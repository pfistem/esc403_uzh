## Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally. Early detection of skin
cancer can save lives, and image classification may provide an efficient and objective
method of diagnosing skin lesions for clinicians and dermatologists.

## Research Questions and goals
1. Data analysis questions: How accurately can we classify skin lesions into malignant
and benign using our model?
2. Practical implications: Create a user friendly interface where pictures of lesions
can be uploaded.
